1. [Wildtrack dataset](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/cvlab/data/data-wildtrack/) http://documents.epfl.ch/groups/c/cv/cvlab-unit/www/data/Wildtrack/Wildtrack_dataset_full.zip

The data acquisition took place in front of the main building of ETH Zurich, Switzerland, during nice weather conditions. The sequences are of resolution 1920Ã—1080 pixels, shot at 60 frames per second.

2. [Cityscapes](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/cityscapes)

Cityscapes is a large-scale database which focuses on semantic understanding of urban street scenes. It provides semantic, instance-wise, and dense pixel annotations for 30 classes grouped into 8 categories (flat surfaces, humans, vehicles, constructions, objects, nature, sky, and void).

3. [INRIA Person Dataset](http://pascal.inrialpes.fr/data/human/)
This dataset was collected as part of research work on detection of upright people in images and video. The research is described in detail in CVPR 2005 paper Histograms of Oriented Gradients for Human Detection and my PhD thesis. The dataset is divided in two formats: (a) original images with corresponding annotation files, and (b) positive images in normalized 64x128 pixel format (as used in the CVPR paper) with original negative images.

4. [Wider Person](http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/users/sfzhang/WiderPerson/)
The WiderPerson dataset is a pedestrian detection benchmark dataset in the wild, of which images are selected from a wide range of scenarios, no longer limited to the traffic scenario. We choose 13,382 images and label about 400K annotations with various kinds of occlusions. We randomly select 8000/1000/4382 images as training, validation and testing subsets. Similar to CityPersons and WIDER FACE datasets, we do not release the bounding box ground truths for the test images. Users are required to submit final prediction files, which we shall proceed to evaluate.
